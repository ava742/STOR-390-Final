# A Glimpse Into The Future: The Ethical Implications of Predicting Patient Mortality

This repository hosts a PDF and R Markdown file for the STOR 390 (Machine Learning: Ethics and Society) Final Project. It analyzes/critiques the methods, results, and moral considerations of the journal article “Development of a prognostic model for mortality in COVID-19 infection using machine learning” by Adam L. Booth, Elizabeth Abels, and Peter McCaffrey. This essay argues that through a Deontological lens, utilizing this algorithm to predict patient mortality and thereby assist in the differential allocation of medical resources is not morally sound.
